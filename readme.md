This project was about [weixin mini-game](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/minigame/dev/index.html) with [rxjs](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/);

##Purpose

This project was inspired by [taming-snakes](https://blog.thoughtram.io/rxjs/2017/08/24/taming-snakes-with-reactive-streams.html)
It was interesting and I thought the games I played in my childhood caught be migrated in mini-game also.Now this Tetris is done and 
more games will be finished next.
